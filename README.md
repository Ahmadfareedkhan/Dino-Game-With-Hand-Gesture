# Dino-Game-With-Hand-Gesture
In this project, I use OpenCV and background subtraction technique to isolate the hand image from the background through segmentation. By using hand gestures, we control the movement of a game character, such as making it jump or duck, based on the number of fingers we show to the camera.
